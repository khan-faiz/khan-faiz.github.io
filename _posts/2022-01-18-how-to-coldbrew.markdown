**Cold-brew coffee** is defined as the satisfying beverage made from the steeping of ground *Coffea arabica*  beans in room-temperature water over periods of 12-24 hours. Records suggest this manner of coffee brewing originated in Japan in the 1600s, however this might only be a artifact of historical record-keeping rather than evidence of an absolute pinpoint in time to the creation of the technique[^1].

*Arabica coffee beans, a necessary ingredient*

Anecdotally the flavor of cold-brew is less bitter, and due to an increase in relative strength, one can stretch the usual bag of beans quite a bit more than usual, which may be desired for flavor-chasers and penny-pinchers. Due to the lack of heat in the extraction of compounds, and the increase in brew time from the coffee, you have differences in flavor profile and caffiene content from typical methods involving heat[^2]. 

This short guide aims to describe a rough methodology to making cold-brew coffee for the inquisitive and curious. Fellows who embark on this path will be rewarded with robust flavor and (if desired) additional strength in their future brews. 

You will need:
  * coffee beans
  * a container able to hold around 1 liter (or 4 cups)
  * mesh strainer or coffee filters

#### **Step 1: Grind**

The first step is to open your bag of jelly beans. If your beans are solid (whole) then you must find a way to reduce them into smaller pieces.

*Your grounds may look like rock, rubble or gravel*

Ideally, your beans are crushed in a compactor, but barring ready access to such equipment, a handheld grinder (manual or otherwise) will suffice. In the absence of this machinery still your beans will require physical massage on pavement. In all cases, a fine grind is unnecessary (and harmful to the final result) so fret not if stones and projectile motion are the road taken here.

#### **Step 2: Measure and Pour**

Next, we will need to measure the ideal quantity of ground to use in our brew. This is not an exact science, as caffiene content varies with bean type and other factors during cultivation. However, it is worth re-iterating cold-brew methods typically result in higher amounts of caffiene, and adjusting downward for a first brew is perfectly acceptable. A full discussion on brew strength parameters is given as an appendix to this post.

For example, if you utilize half a cup (1/2) of ground in your daily drip usually, then you may consider conservatively measuring half that much (1/4 cup ground) in this step to reduce the strength, and move them into your container.

Next, we pour water to some pre-determined ratio. Usually a ratio of 1 cup of ground to 4 cups of water should be sufficient, or 1:4. For a half cup of coffee, then you would utilize 2 cups of water, or 1/2:2. For 1/4 cup of ground, 1 cup of water, or 1/4:1, et cetera. This ratio may be altered to enhance or reduce the flavor or strength of the resulting brew, the closer the ratio gets to 0, the weaker the overall result, and the closer to 1, the stronger it will be.

#### **Step 3: Steep and Strain**

Next, place this container in the fridge or counter for 12-48 hours, depending on personal tastes. The fridge is preferred for reasons that the coffee will keep longer than at room temperature, but ultimately the decision is yours.

*Let time do the hard work in the brew*

The only thing left to do at this point is filter the resulting liquid and serve, this can be achieved with a coffee filter or a strainer, even cheesecloth or a french press if that is the only filtration on hand.

Serve cold, over ice, milk or microwave if you must have a hot beverage. Congratulations, you are now a Cold Brew Master™!

#### **Closing Remarks**

Caffeine is one of the sacred chemicals of the American experience, and until you have it coursing in your blood, I can say that you have not really lived. It should be approached with appreciation, reverence and caution in every case. I hope you have learned something of value reading this post, please know that I feel much pleasure now the techniques of cold brew have been passed on. Do share your learnings amongst the rest of the tribe when you return, I hope to hear of your adventures soon, fellow traveler.

#### Appendix: Discussion on brew strength
Typically there are several vectors by which to tune the strength of the brew. The process for the perfect brew thus is highly dependent on trial and error. Assuming we do not have total dominion, we can control for grounds quantity, water used during/after the brew, and steep time.

##### **Quantity**

If over-caffination is a concern, then it seems reasonable to use **less than** your usual amount of coffee grounds from your usual brewing methods such as drip. Even if you are used to a certain level of caffiene from your typical quantity of grounds, you should understand the final brew will be (usually considerably) stronger due to the brew times and method, and here we can compensate for that. 

##### **Dilution**

If you are worried about strength, you can choose to dilute your brew with water, either during the brew or after you pour your cup. Personally, I prefer to dilute beforehand, but this is preference. In this step, you can increase the ratio of grounds to water from 1:4 to 1:6, or even 1:8 if your container allows. For example, using the 1:6 ratio, a half cup of ground would originally require (1/2):2 would now have 3 cups of water for half a cup of ground, or (1/2):3. 

##### **Time**

A longer steep will typically result in more bitter flavors and higher caffiene content, with a middle ground being somewhere around 16-24 hours. A lighter brew would then be started in the morning and be strained that evening, a moderate brew the next morning, and a strong brew an extra morning after the last. The exact timing comes down to experimentation, but a rough guess would suggest a weak-to-moderate brew at 16 hours, and moderate-to-strong at 24 hours. 

Because all three parameters have such a strong effect on the flavor profile and caffiene content, it is well worthwhile to experiment to find the right combination, but to start at whatever end of the spectrum (light/strong) and fine-tune until you obtain your ideal brew.
